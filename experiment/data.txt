Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that develops algorithms able to learn from data and generalize to new situations without explicit programming. Grounded in statistics, optimization, and data mining, ML is widely applied in natural language processing, computer vision, speech recognition, medicine, agriculture, and business analytics. Deep learning, a subset of ML using neural networks, has surpassed many traditional approaches in performance and drives much of modern AI progress.

Historically, ML traces back to Donald Hebb’s theories of neural structures in 1949 and Arthur Samuel’s checkers program in the 1950s. Research expanded in the 1960s–80s with reinforcement learning, symbolic AI, and early neural networks, but it was the rediscovery of backpropagation in the 1980s that revived interest. By the 1990s, ML became recognized as its own discipline, shifting from symbolic reasoning to data-driven, statistical methods aimed at solving practical problems.
